# CADD_5-STAGE RISCV PROCESSOR
To Design A “5-STAGE RISC V PROCESSOR” For That We Wrote Verilog Codes For Individual Each Stage. FIVE STAGE – INSTRUCTION FETCH, INSTRUCTION DECODE, INSTRUCTION EXECUTE, MEMORY ACCESS, WRITE BACK
THE FIRST STAGE IS "INSTRUCTION FETCH" WHERE IT HAS PC COUNTER(64BIT),INSTRUCTION MEMORY(WHICH IS NOTHING BUT ROM-READ ONLY MEMORY)(32BIT),2:1 MUX,ADDER etc
